## Description
Meta-Connect is developed in MS Teams. It is aiming to empower every user of Microsoft Teams can be connected more in an online world. Meta-Connect is a wonderful tool for new employee onboarding, virtual team building, and online communication. You can create your own meta-card to display educational background, technical certificates, interests and hobbies. Teams can customize their meta-space by placing team photos, event videos, office scenes and creating virtual parties.

Meta-Connect values the connection among people and provides online features for you to interact with others. Especially at this particular time when people can't meet in person during the pandemic, we don't want to lose touch with our friends and colleagues! Let's welcome Meta-Connect!
